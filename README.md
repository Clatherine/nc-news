Welcome to Hot Off the Press News: a news site on all things coding, cooking and football!

At Hot Off the Press News, you can browse articles on the home page, filtered by topic and sorted according to date published, number of votes and number of comments (ordered either top to bottom, or bottom to top : your choice!). Note that the default settings are all topics, sorted by date, latest to oldest.

When you have found an article you'd like to read, click the 'Read article' button to take you to a new page where you can read the article and its associated comments, and leave your own comment if you so wish. Don't forget to upvote the article if you enjoyed reading it! Or if you didn't, give it a thumbs down. 

If you want to remove a comment, feel free to click the 'Delete' button on any of your comments. Note you can't delete other users' comments as that wouldn't be fair. 

When you want to return to the home page to browse more articles, simply click the 'Home' link in the top left hand corner of the navigation bar.
